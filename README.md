# Carbon-Emission-Prediction-
This project predicts carbon emissions using various machine learning models on historical data from Kaggle. Key steps include data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, outlier treatment, and model evaluation (LSTM, GRU, SimpleRNN). The study identifies the most effective model for accurate emission forecasting.
